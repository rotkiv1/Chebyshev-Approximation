...and we want to write a programm, that is going take these points x, y coordinates, and approximate them with a curve (basically, this programm does this), and the result is following\

You can adjust number of points which make the curve, or adjust an interval (here, in the example above, i used number of points equals 300, and the interval [5, 6] for x
